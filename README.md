# MIPS-Simulator

## Introduction

MIPS-Simulator runs MIPS32 programs.
Unlike real simulator, which assembles the instructions into machine code and executes them, 
MIPS-Simulator just parse the instructions and runs them using python code.
In other words, MIPS-simulator actually interprets mips instructions.
